# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler
This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers. The `POST /users` route is vulnerable because it lacks proper checks for empty or invalid request bodies and doesn't handle database errors gracefully.  This can lead to unexpected application crashes or insecure responses to clients.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The route handler attempts to create a new user but doesn't check if `req.body` is valid or empty before attempting database operations.  Error handling is inadequate, logging the error to the console instead of sending a proper response to the client.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code. It includes robust error handling that validates the request body, handles database errors, and provides appropriate HTTP responses for various scenarios.
